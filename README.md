# Currency_bot
This bot I have been developing for a several months from now. This is my very first Python project which was made not only for learning and studyung purposes, but also for the commercial reasons - I started it because my friend needed some automation for his currency exchange buisness.
I based this bot on aiogram library, which is not really difficult to use. I faced several issues during the process of development, but I've tried to fix them most efficiently.
# Quick guide for containments of of the project:
'main.py' includes all handlers for queries and messages and some important variables

'bot.py' contains Telegram bot token and introduces short-named variables for handling it to the functions

'keyboards.py' is the builder for all keyboards and buttons

'course_request.py' introduces function which makes request for the api of bank and gets required exchange rate. Note that API requires special access, so you won't be able to use it on your own machine.


This bot is active 24/7 for commercial purposes and can be shown if you are interested. Text me anytime in Telegram @pashaborsch. I'm also opened for advices and tips about coding and I would be happy to discuss some programming topics with you.

Warning: this app was developed with Aiogram 2.X, and will not start under 3.X version. Bot will be updated to 3.X soon.
